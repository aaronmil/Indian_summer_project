International news in recent years has reported on the record setting high temperatures in India during the summer, with such viral images of pedestrians whose melting shoes stick to the hot pavement. The objective of this analysis is to examine data from previous summers in four major cities in India and attempt to predict max temperatures for future summers in those four cities. Historical data shows relatively consistent temperature patterns for Mumbai and Bengaluru, and relatively inconsistent patterns for New Delhi and Kolkata. Therefore the models had an easier time forecasting for the former two than it did for the latter two.
